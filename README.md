# BCM Continuity Planner

Personal portfolio/demo tool for Business Impact Analysis (BIA), Business Continuity Plan (BCP), and Crisis Management Plan (CMP) development — built by Peter van Walsem to establish a market presence as a BCM specialist.

**Status:** Planning phase. Not yet implemented.

## Scope

This is a personal-use tool, not intended for production deployment within any employer's environment. See [REQUIREMENTS.md](./REQUIREMENTS.md) for the full functional/non-functional requirements and the scope decision, and [DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md](./DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md) for the phased build plan.

## Why this exists

A GitHub prior-art check (documented in REQUIREMENTS.md) found no open-source tool combining a full BIA engine (MTPD/RTO/RPO/MBCO with enforced business rules) with BCP generation, crisis management, and exercise planning in one place. This project fills that gap as a demonstrable, standards-aligned (ISO 22301:2019, ISO/TS 22317, NIST SP 800-34 Rev 1, BCI GPG 7.0) tool.

## Architecture (planned)

- Python backend, FastMCP server (consistent with the author's other IT risk tooling: `pqc-cbom-risk-auditor`, `ai-risk-auditor`, `vendor-soc-isae-auditor`, `stride-threat-modeler`)
- SQLite/JSON data store
- Standalone HTML dashboard
- Append-only JSON audit log

## Documents

- [REQUIREMENTS.md](./REQUIREMENTS.md) — Full functional & non-functional requirements, scope decision, prior art check.
- [DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md](./DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md) — High-level phased development plan (Phase 0–5) and next steps.
